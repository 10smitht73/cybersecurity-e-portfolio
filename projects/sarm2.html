                                            <p><strong>Question: </strong>Discuss 'Industry 4.0' as explained in Kovaitė and Stankevičienė, 2019.</p>
                                            <h4>Initial Post</h4>
                                            <p>Kovaitė and Stankevičienė (2019) discuss Industry 4.0: the 4th industrial revolution that evolves from the internet and automation age into the age of cyber physical systems (Loughlin, 2018). One of the technologies discussed as driving this revolution is the Internet of Things (IoT) which has allowed normal devices and tools to become a complex network of sensors collecting varied data across all industries. These diverse and vast datasets can then in turn be interpreted and analysed in another Industry 4.0 technology, known as Big Data. Together these advancements allow devices to be aware of their own context and make decisions to optimise their performance (Gokalp et al., 2016).</p>
                                            <p>IoT devices are continually upgrading by nature. Technological advancements, security patches and volatility of legislation surrounding these new devices mean that products are quickly obsolete - which would be categorised as a technical risk by Kovaitė and Stankevičienė (2019). The culture shift towards cloud services has happened within a single workforce generation, and so companies can easily find themselves with staff who are unable to use this technology to its full potential (not to mention optimal configuration). The paper would categorise this as an example of a competence risk.</p>
                                            <p>Mekhdiev et al. (2023) agrees that a corporate risk landscape is clearly impacted by digitisation, and requires a new model to anticipate these new risks. However, they also go on to suggest that this model should focus on highlighting the advantages which are often the adverse of the risks. It is suggested that this is the only way to truly offset the risks of digitisation.</p>

                                            <p><strong>Question: </strong>Discuss 'Industry 4.0' as explained in Kovaitė and Stankevičienė, 2019.</p>
                                            <h4>Summary Post</h4>
                                            <p>An enjoyable discussion around a topic that is very much current. Daniel, Bing and Chih have contributed to the discussion of Industry 4.0 based on the source material by Kovaitė and Stankevičienė (2019).</p>
                                            <p>Daniel and Bing agreed and furthered my point that the rapid change being experienced in industry is creating obsolescence problems with both technology and staff. As Daniel explains, assessment of staff knowledge gaps is paramount to ensure successful transition into the use of new equipment and processes (Nikou et al., 2022). Although the “human factor” is now considered the main vulnerability in business information security (Jeong et al., 2019), one might argue that it is in fact the relationship between humans and technology that will become most critical - especially as cyber physical systems become more prevalent and replace manual work.</p>
                                            <p>Chih presented further findings on the risks of IoT devices. It was proposed that, although businesses must carry out appropriate risk assessment before integrating any device with their network or equipment, this risk is also shared by the vendor whose company reputation could be impacted by their product being the weak link. Nurse et al. (2017) comment on approaches that can be taken in order to assess these risks successfully such as NIST SP800-30, OCTAVE, and CRAMM amongst others.</p>
                                            <p>The conclusion of the discussion is in agreement with the conclusion of Kovaitė and Stankevičienė (2019). Business models must implement appropriate risk assessment when transitioning to Industry 4.0 and digitisation should be embraced with careful planning. But, of course, this is not a tick box exercise to be completed once. Just as regular patching and upgrades is key to mitigate software vulnerabilities, regular risk assessment of implemented technologies throughout their use lifetime is the most comprehensive way to understand the threats of Industry 4.0.</p>
