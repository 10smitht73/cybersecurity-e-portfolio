                                    <p><strong>Question: </strong>Discuss why Cyber Security is now a global issue and why it is important for companies to invest in Cyber Security.</p>

                                            <h3>Initial Post</h3>
                                            <p>The world is undoubtedly more connected than ever before. In the home, the mass acceptance of smart devices has led to the ever expanding Internet of Things; including devices that come from companies across the world (Sadhu et al., 2022). From fridges to frames, everything has become connected to the internet and so the globalisation of trade which has allowed items to be bought from all over the globe has become a global network of devices with varying security considerations. Many of these devices also contain microphones, cameras, or other data capturing facilities which ferry information to data centres worldwide (Anderson, 2020).</p>
                                            <p>Furthermore, in business, people are more able to work across the globe as the COVID-19 pandemic amplified the already growing trend of home working and the normalisation of bring-your-own-devices (Hubbard et al., 2021). Not only are workers able to utilise their home network for work purposes (which is likely poorly configured and unmonitored), they are also more likely to be collaborating with employees across the globe.</p>
                                            <p>Of course, these factors contribute to cybersecurity becoming a global issue. Threat actors from any country can exploit weaknesses in home security by finding the weakest link in your household internet of things. They can also take advantage of previously ‘air-gapped’ secure networks being opened up to the internet in order to facilitate working internationally. One may be reminded of the idea of finding balance between giving a system functionality and optimising security, and how these are often intrinsically opposed (Anderson, 2020). The more we connect our world, the more avenues we open up for potential threat.</p>

                                            <p>Craig and Mihail have corroborated my point that the IoT is a prime example of cyber security as a global issue and why companies must invest in mitigating vulnerabilities. As Craig mentions, IoT reach has become so wide that government agencies, as well as threat actors, are looking at ways to maximise their intelligence collection and surveillance potential (Anderson, 2020). As Mihail adds, this doesn’t just provide a potential gateway into our home networks, but some of these devices are also building a sophisticated profile of our actions, behaviours, and routines (Clauser, 2019) - without even considering any connected metadata. At an individual level, this gives attackers information that can be used for a more convincing spear-phish or to deliver a more emotionally-targeted ransomware attack. On a larger scale, these profiles could even be used to influence society as a means of misguiding democracy (Troncoso, 2021).</p>
                                            <p>These risks demonstrate clear ethical arguments for investment. However, all too often, corporate decisions can be based on financials and, as Mihail mentions, companies have come to realise the value of data: selling data-capturing devices to us in order to capitalise on this commodity. Further to Craig’s comment on CCTV, many of these items are cheaply produced and hence vulnerabilities have been easily found and exploited. A study into a cheap IP camera (Favaretto et al., 2020) found that there was no requirement to verify an email address and a fake address could be used to watch a live camera stream: going against the IEEE principle (demonstrated in Unit 3) of authenticating before authorising (Arce et al., 2014). Companies must beware the false economy of cheap production. With consumers becoming ever more aware of the need to protect their own data, products/services can easily be overshadowed by a more security-oriented competitor (Chronopoulos et al., 2017).</p>
                                            <p>This single example of global technology alone demands that companies invest in cybersecurity appropriately.</p>

									<p><strong>Title: </strong>You have just setup an IT consultancy firm specialising in cyber security. There is a local grocery shop which serves the catchment area and expanding rapidly. You are looking to develop a proposal to the shop owner detailing the benefits of an online system as well as the potential problems including cyber threats.</p>
									<p>Word count: 2000 words.</p>
									<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br>Technological development is indisputably relevant to grocery retailing; both in terms of value enhancement and cyber threat (Weyer et al., 2020). In 2021, online grocery accounted for 12% of the UK grocery market and that figure is expected to rise to as much as 30% by 2030 (Simmons et al., 2022). Potential vulnerability to cyber attacks as well as fear of non-compliance with data legislation are genuine business risks, but please do not dismiss new technology on the basis of these initial concerns. Customers are vocal on their appetite for e-commerce (Saikrishnan, 2023), but trust of the online system is a key influence on whether customers make a purchase (Tyrväinen & Karjaluoto, 2022), and it is therefore imperative that the risks are properly assessed and the correct cyber security practices are implemented.</p>

                                                <h4>Intrusion Detection Systems</h4>
                                                <p>Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) play a pivotal role in defending against cyber threats, particularly those that operate discreetly, leaving victims unaware of compromise. Whether exploiting a zero-day vulnerability or infiltrating systems as a Trojan Horse, detecting and notifying sysadmin of a breach promptly is critical for mitigating consequences. </p>
                                                <p>Intrusions, which are described as a threat against CIA (confidentiality, integrity, availability) or an attempt to bypass computer/network security mechanisms (Bace & Mell, 2001), are varied in nature and so require the implementation of varying detection systems. Firstly, misuse detection looks for suspicious user activity by comparing it to known signatures (such as contacting an IP that is known to be malicious) (Anderson, 2020). While this is effective against known vulnerabilities, it is unable to detect new threats and the validity of the signatures can be laborious to maintain (Liao et al., 2013). Secondly, anomaly detection systems attempt to identify behaviour that deviates from what the system has been trained to expect - often based on user profiles (Anderson, 2020). This allows detection of unknown vulnerabilities but comes at the cost of a high rate of false positive detections as user behaviour can be difficult to predict (Liao et al., 2013).</p>
                                                <h4>Data Leakage Prevention</h4>
                                                <p>While IDS is concerned with preventing network ingress, Data Leakage Prevention (DLP) mitigates attempts to extract information from a system - a practice that has become more difficult as our data has become increasingly agile. It is relatively trivial to protect data that is at rest in a system when compared with the task of protecting data travelling through a network or being used at an endpoint (Raman, 2011). A typical Data Loss Prevention System (DLPS) employs monitoring mechanisms such as regular expressions, data fingerprinting, and statistical analysis to identify sensitive data. Once the system has determined that a compromise is taking place, detection actions such as notifying and auditing can precede protection actions of blocking, encrypting and quarantining (Alneyadi, 2016). Interestingly, increasing popularity of HTTPS has created challenges for DLP systems despite being implemented to protect data (Anderson, 2020). Since HTTPS encrypts data before initiating transit, DLP systems have much more difficulty confirming whether that data is permitted to be transmitted.</p>
                                                <p>Notably, both types of intrusion detection as well as data leakage prevention benefit greatly from advancements in machine learning. Misuse signatures can be considered more holistically and anomaly patterns can be more broadly analysed for a greater, more accurate capture rate (Ahmad et al., 2023). In DLP, larger datasets and their context can be considered more intelligently and security classification or encryption can be suitably added without the user needing to take action (Ghouse, 2019).</p>

                                                <h3>Summary Post</h3>
                                                <p>Syed and Daniel have agreed that Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Data Leakage Prevention Systems (DLPS) are crucial security components to incorporate in cyber security. Daniel particularly explained that the variety of preventative measures that a DLPS can take to avoid a data breach is hugely beneficial, but also adds that poorly classified/tagged data is much harder to shepherd (Gupta et al., 2022). The old adage of “garbage in, garbage out” rings true here and further acknowledges the criticality of human configuration regardless of technological advancement (Kilkenny & Robertson, 2018).</p>
                                                <p>As elaborated by Stephanie, a key advantage of IDS is that threats can be detected in real time and hence reacted to quickly - reducing the window of opportunity for attackers. This advantage seems particularly desirable when considering IBM’s report (2023) that the average breach discovered by internal cyber security teams takes 182 days to identify.</p>
                                                <p>Craig adds to my point on false positives as a drawback of IDS, but also applying it to DLPS - confirming false positives to be a widespread issue in automated detection of any kind. This is not surprising considering Anderson’s (2020) inference that even a 0.1% false positive rate can provide an unfathomable number of alerts to manage in a large, complex system.</p>
                                                <p>A key theme of the discussion has been the use of artificial intelligence/machine learning to overcome weaknesses of the two systems. Syed commented on its use to combat the number of false positive alerts created by IDS when scanning for anomalous user behaviour. A study by Oliveira (2021) calls anomaly detection an “exciting area” for the application of neural networks, although the research states that the integration of AI in IDS is hindered by a lack of reliable data with which to train these algorithms. Al-Khater et al. (2020) proposes that more data could be available through collaboration between researchers and cyber law enforcement to create cyber criminal profiles, however, the sensitivity of much of this data makes this unlikely.</p>
