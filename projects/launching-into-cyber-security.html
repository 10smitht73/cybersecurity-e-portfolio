												<h3>Initial Post</h3>
												<p>The world is undoubtedly more connected than ever before. In the home, the mass acceptance of smart devices has led to the ever expanding Internet of Things; including devices that come from companies across the world (Sadhu et al., 2022). From fridges to frames, everything has become connected to the internet and so the globalisation of trade which has allowed items to be bought from all over the globe has become a global network of devices with varying security considerations. Many of these devices also contain microphones, cameras, or other data capturing facilities which ferry information to data centres worldwide (Anderson, 2020).</p>
                                                <p>Furthermore, in business, people are more able to work across the globe as the COVID-19 pandemic amplified the already growing trend of home working and the normalisation of bring-your-own-devices (Hubbard et al., 2021). Not only are workers able to utilise their home network for work purposes (which is likely poorly configured and unmonitored), they are also more likely to be collaborating with employees across the globe.</p>
                                                <p>Of course, these factors contribute to cybersecurity becoming a global issue. Threat actors from any country can exploit weaknesses in home security by finding the weakest link in your household internet of things. They can also take advantage of previously ‘air-gapped’ secure networks being opened up to the internet in order to facilitate working internationally. One may be reminded of the idea of finding balance between giving a system functionality and optimising security, and how these are often intrinsically opposed (Anderson, 2020). The more we connect our world, the more avenues we open up for potential threat.</p>

												<h3>Summary Post</h3>
												<p>Craig and Mihail have corroborated my point that the IoT is a prime example of cyber security as a global issue and why companies must invest in mitigating vulnerabilities. As Craig mentions, IoT reach has become so wide that government agencies, as well as threat actors, are looking at ways to maximise their intelligence collection and surveillance potential (Anderson, 2020). As Mihail adds, this doesn’t just provide a potential gateway into our home networks, but some of these devices are also building a sophisticated profile of our actions, behaviours, and routines (Clauser, 2019) - without even considering any connected metadata. At an individual level, this gives attackers information that can be used for a more convincing spear-phish or to deliver a more emotionally-targeted ransomware attack. On a larger scale, these profiles could even be used to influence society as a means of misguiding democracy (Troncoso, 2021).</p>
                                                <p>These risks demonstrate clear ethical arguments for investment. However, all too often, corporate decisions can be based on financials and, as Mihail mentions, companies have come to realise the value of data: selling data-capturing devices to us in order to capitalise on this commodity. Further to Craig’s comment on CCTV, many of these items are cheaply produced and hence vulnerabilities have been easily found and exploited. A study into a cheap IP camera (Favaretto et al., 2020) found that there was no requirement to verify an email address and a fake address could be used to watch a live camera stream: going against the IEEE principle (demonstrated in Unit 3) of authenticating before authorising (Arce et al., 2014). Companies must beware the false economy of cheap production. With consumers becoming ever more aware of the need to protect their own data, products/services can easily be overshadowed by a more security-oriented competitor (Chronopoulos et al., 2017).</p>
                                                <p>This single example of global technology alone demands that companies invest in cybersecurity appropriately.</p>
