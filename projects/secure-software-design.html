                                            <p><strong>Question: </strong>Discuss 'Industry 4.0' as explained in Kovaitė and Stankevičienė, 2019.</p>
                                            <h4>Initial Post</h4>
                                            <p>Kovaitė and Stankevičienė (2019) discuss Industry 4.0: the 4th industrial revolution that evolves from the internet and automation age into the age of cyber physical systems (Loughlin, 2018). One of the technologies discussed as driving this revolution is the Internet of Things (IoT) which has allowed normal devices and tools to become a complex network of sensors collecting varied data across all industries. These diverse and vast datasets can then in turn be interpreted and analysed in another Industry 4.0 technology, known as Big Data. Together these advancements allow devices to be aware of their own context and make decisions to optimise their performance (Gokalp et al., 2016).</p>
                                            <p>IoT devices are continually upgrading by nature. Technological advancements, security patches and volatility of legislation surrounding these new devices mean that products are quickly obsolete - which would be categorised as a technical risk by Kovaitė and Stankevičienė (2019). The culture shift towards cloud services has happened within a single workforce generation, and so companies can easily find themselves with staff who are unable to use this technology to its full potential (not to mention optimal configuration). The paper would categorise this as an example of a competence risk.</p>
                                            <p>Mekhdiev et al. (2023) agrees that a corporate risk landscape is clearly impacted by digitisation, and requires a new model to anticipate these new risks. However, they also go on to suggest that this model should focus on highlighting the advantages which are often the adverse of the risks. It is suggested that this is the only way to truly offset the risks of digitisation.</p>

                                        <blockquote>This unit has given a great introduction to risk management. Interestingly it seems to have prompted more questions than it has answered (as should any good introduction), such as relating to the diverse definitions of risk, the huge range of topics that it can cover, and the variety of mitigations available. Writing the initial post for the discussion was difficult because I did not enjoy the literature piece that was being studied. Although the ideas were interesting, the formulae was poorly explained with hardly any declaration of variables, and ‘table 5’ was referenced as an important template but did not even feature in any versions of the document that I could find. I have a background in mathematics, but I can imagine that someone without this experience may not have known that further explanation was necessary which could have been disarming for them. As Hernik & Jaworska (2018) explains, if a concept is difficult to understand, it affects both enjoyment and knowledge retention.</blockquote>
                                        <blockquote>Despite this, I researched Industry 4.0 and found an illuminating explanation of the transition from 3.0 to 4.0 which helped to highlight the differences - Loughlin (2018). This has taught me not to be disheartened by distaste of a source, and to appreciate difference in perspective and style. The importance of a topic shouldn’t be undermined by the quality of a single source.</blockquote>

                                            <h4>Activity Notes</h4>
                                            <p>Read the Spears & Barki (2010) article then prepare answers to the following questions:</p>
                                            <p><strong>1. How did the authors use both Qualitative and Quantitative assessment approaches? What benefits did each approach yield?</strong></p>
                                            <p>A combination of data collection and analysis, interviews and surveys. Qualitative was necessary as there was very little known data on which to base a quantitative analysis, quantitative were then used to test the theoretical model defined from the qualitative study. Combining the two provided context and testability. Idea was that two different approaches to the same problem would yield a more whole picture.</p>
                                            <p><strong>2. What do the authors list as the advantages of involving users in the risk management process?</strong></p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Buy-in Theory - users that participate in risk management are likely to feel more engaged in the activity in the future.</li>
                                                <li>Organisational awareness around those who participated increased.</li>
                                                <li>Users provided context that made the risk management more business aligned.</li>
                                                <li>Good relationships form between users and IS professionals which can benefit the company in future IS endeavours.</li>

                                            </ul>
                                            <p><strong>3. How will the lack of user access affect the risk assessment you will carry out as part of your assessment?</strong></p>
                                            <p>More assumptions will have to be made to compensate for the lack of business context that users can provide. The advantages/risks will need to be explained thoroughly to demonstrate the need for compliance in lieu of the ‘buy-in’ that might have been.</p>
                                            <p><strong>4. Will it affect the choice of Qualitative vs. Quantitative assessment methods you utilise?</strong></p>
                                            <p>A mixture of qualitative and quantitative will be used as there is also limited historical data available in our study. However, the benefits and conclusions that can be taken from quantitative analysis cannot be ignored. A mixture of the two limits the number of assumptions that need to be made.</p>
                                            <p><strong>5. How might you mitigate any issues encountered?</strong></p>
                                            <p>Assumptions, as long as they are properly recorded, can be used to model the case around any issues. Before doing so, any issues should be investigated and researched to find if there is a previous encounter of this issue which has a known workaround.</p>

                                        <blockquote>In team 1, the initial meeting was hindered by the fact that Fatma had not made any contact in the introduction forum. This meant that we hadn’t been able to communicate with her and so only three of us were present for this initial meeting. While this allowed us to get to know each other better, the contract required that all four of us participated and so this is likely to hinder the progress of the project. Although I appreciate that this is a flexible course, it is important to adhere to deadlines - especially when working with others. I am going to take note of this for my own development and ensure that I am punctual and contributing to the team, as I understand the frustration that this may cause for others.</blockquote>
                                        <blockquote>I am excited by the prospect of the team project as it seems very imitative of a real life scenario. Unfortunately, there is very little factual data in the brief that can be used, but this does allow for more creative freedom and we will need to be careful with assumptions.</blockquote>
                                        <blockquote>Our first team call with all four members gave the impression that Tyrone and I are more comfortable providing ideas and sharing knowledge, whereas Fatma and Stephen are less confident and may need some support. We have made the decision to split the assignment into two teams with myself and Fatma working on a risk analysis of before the digitalisation, and Tyrone and Stephen working on the post digitalisation analysis. This was my suggestion to mitigate the issue of everyone working on the same section of the document which may have led to repeats or inconsistencies. However, Tyrone was slightly concerned that there may be a mismatch in the sections, and so this will need to be addressed when editing.</blockquote>
                                        <blockquote>As we are all in different timezones, I have also created and shared a reference so that we can organise calls more effectively and be mindful of each other's schedules.</blockquote>

                                            <p><strong>Question: </strong>Discuss 'Industry 4.0' as explained in Kovaitė and Stankevičienė, 2019.</p>
                                            <h4>Summary Post</h4>
                                            <p>An enjoyable discussion around a topic that is very much current. Daniel, Bing and Chih have contributed to the discussion of Industry 4.0 based on the source material by Kovaitė and Stankevičienė (2019).</p>
                                            <p>Daniel and Bing agreed and furthered my point that the rapid change being experienced in industry is creating obsolescence problems with both technology and staff. As Daniel explains, assessment of staff knowledge gaps is paramount to ensure successful transition into the use of new equipment and processes (Nikou et al., 2022). Although the “human factor” is now considered the main vulnerability in business information security (Jeong et al., 2019), one might argue that it is in fact the relationship between humans and technology that will become most critical - especially as cyber physical systems become more prevalent and replace manual work.</p>
                                            <p>Chih presented further findings on the risks of IoT devices. It was proposed that, although businesses must carry out appropriate risk assessment before integrating any device with their network or equipment, this risk is also shared by the vendor whose company reputation could be impacted by their product being the weak link. Nurse et al. (2017) comment on approaches that can be taken in order to assess these risks successfully such as NIST SP800-30, OCTAVE, and CRAMM amongst others.</p>
                                            <p>The conclusion of the discussion is in agreement with the conclusion of Kovaitė and Stankevičienė (2019). Business models must implement appropriate risk assessment when transitioning to Industry 4.0 and digitisation should be embraced with careful planning. But, of course, this is not a tick box exercise to be completed once. Just as regular patching and upgrades is key to mitigate software vulnerabilities, regular risk assessment of implemented technologies throughout their use lifetime is the most comprehensive way to understand the threats of Industry 4.0.</p>

                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Vulnerabilities are the weakness in a system, and threats are events that may exploit a vulnerability.</li>
                                                <li>Threat modelling can be thought of as a collection of guidelines in the same way as the agile framework.</li>
                                                <li>CVSS< OCTAVE, attack trees, PASTA, ATT&CK, and OWASP can all be useful in threat modelling.</li>

                                        <blockquote>The first collaborative discussion forum has finished and there was a clear lack of acknowledgement of the formulae described in the source material which confirms my previous reflection that it is not well explained. Daniel made a particularly interesting point that the faster technology moves on, the more likely humans are to be left behind and so it is vital to assess staff knowledge throughout the process (Nikou et al, 2022). I found that there was a high rate of agreement in the discussion which was friendly, but perhaps didn’t challenge people to prove their ideas more robustly . In future discussions, I will aim to take a more critical view of people’s arguments as my job as a tester can benefit from a critical stance that looks beyond face value.</blockquote>

I decided to make the plan simple as we hadn't elected a leader so I didn't want the rest of the team to feel that I was managing them. I shared this with the group and suggested that we each add bullet points, ideas and sources as seeing each other’s thoughts would provide the perspective that is needed for a group task (Salas et al., 2018). We will discuss this in our next group call and then start putting content into the final document draft. Tyrone has given positive feedback on the plan, but has added his own sources to the plan which will give a more rounded argument. Fatma has told me that she doesn’t she doesn’t feel that it needs any additions which I consider to be short-sighted and a poor team contribution. I reacted as if this was a good thing, but on reflection I believe I should have persuaded Fatma to make some of her own comments for the sake of her confidence and personal development.</blockquote>

                                            <h4><strong>Case Study:</strong> Personal Data Withheld from an Access Request by Airbnb on the Basis of an Opinion Given in Confidence</h4>
                                            
                                            <h4>What is the specific aspect of GDPR that your case study addresses?</h4>
                                            <p>The case study addresses the right for a data subject to access any personal data held by a data controller on them (Article 15 of GDPR) (ICO, 2016). More specifically, a data subject wants access to personal data held on them including an email of complaint written about the data subject by another third party. The data controller had to balance the right to this access with the exemptions that can apply when a confidential opinion is expressed.</p>
                                            
                                            <h4>How was it resolved?</h4>
                                            <p>As the third party had informed the data subject that they had contacted the data controller, and most of the email was considered factual, the email was ordered to be shared with the data subject as the exemption did not apply.</p>
                                            
                                            <h4>If this was your organisation what steps would you take as an Information Security Manager to mitigate the issue?</h4>
                                            <p>This reminds me of when I was working as a customer service advisor for Hargreaves Lansdown and we were trained not to write anything untoward about clients in their file even if it was an internal communication as this may have to be released to them under an access request. This should be the foundation of any company that any data on a subject should be treated as if they are constantly watching what you are doing with it. Ensuring appropriate policies should be paramount, but balancing the strictness is also important. They must be strict enough to adhere to GDPR, but if they are too strict then the Peltzman effect can take effect which makes people feel less risk averse, and in fact they may find a workaround (Stetzer & Hofmann, 1996).</p>

                                                <li>GDPR cannot be ignored and requrired proper assessment of risk. Any investigation may require proof of compliance and so proper records must be kept.</li>
                                                <li>COBIT and ITIL are standards/framewworks that can be employed in a business to assist with compliance and both offer useful principles.</li>
                                                <li>PCI-DSS can be implemented all the way from initial design right thorugh to maintainance.</li>

                                        <blockquote>The GDPR case study this week was exciting and beneficial to my development as a cyber security professional as cyber security is at the core of data protection (Gobeo et al., 2022). Cyber security analysts may consider GDPR to be a legal issue and not part of their day job, but legal implications of their work can be instrumental to business failings. Analysing a real life case study shows how these regulations actually affect real life, and the case study that I chose in particular was eye opening as it demonstrated that real situations can be multi-faceted. A company exercising the right to withhold information under GDPR was in fact breaching the subject's right to access their own data. In my own personal development, I translate this as a reinforcement that consequences of actions should always consider how others will be affected to avoid future implications.</blockquote>

                                            <p><strong>Title: </strong>Security Standards</p>
                                            <h4>Activity Notes</h4>
                                            <p>Review GDPR, PCI, and HIPAA and answer the questions:</p>
                                            <h4>Which of the standards discussed in the sources above would apply to the organisation discussed in the assessment?</h4>
                                            <p>For example, a company providing services to anyone living in Europe or a European-based company or public body would most likely be subject to <strong>GDPR</strong>. A company handling online payments would most likely need to meet <strong>PCI-DSS</strong> standards. While pampered pets use of technology is limited, any personal information in the form of emailed orders (and other uses) would mean that <strong>GDPR</strong> still applies. <strong>PCI-DSS</strong> will most certainly apply as the company accepts card payments. <strong>HIPAA</strong> is unlikely to apply, but may in the case that the company has any pet food that specifically caters to medical conditions then those clients' privacy would need to be protected.</p>

                                            <h4>Evaluate the company against the appropriate standards and decide how would you check if standards were being met?</h4>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li><strong>GDPR:</strong> the company's data collection and storage practices would need to be evaluated. In the case of email ordering, could anyone access this without permission? Are there processes in place in the case of data subject access rights such as collation of customer data as it is processed?</li>
                                                <li><strong>PCI-DSS:</strong> assess how payments are taken and how this is recorded. Are they physically secure (such as payment receipts) as well as electronically secure?</li>
                                                <li><strong>HIPAA:</strong> pampered pets would have to audit their products to ensure that clients can not be identified by purchases of health related products. How is pet health information stored?</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <p>To check if standards are being met, documents should be reviewed and audited, inspections of physical security may take place, and CCTV may be looked at.</p>

                                            <h4>What would your recommendations be to meet those standards?</h4>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li><strong>GDPR:</strong> Customer data should be secured both physically and electronically. Any written records throughout the day need to be secured or disposed of. Staff should be trained on the rights of data subjects and responsibilities of data controllers. Procedures should be in place in the case that those rights are exercised.</li>
                                                <li><strong>PCI-DSS:</strong> Ensure any card terminals are compliant with the standards. Cardholder data shouldn’t be stored unless absolutely necessary. Receipts should be kept safe and secure.</li>
                                                <li><strong>HIPAA:</strong> Similar to GDPR but with focus on any pet health records (or health conditions on pet owners for other purposes), access controls, data encryption.</li>
                                            </ul>

                                            <h4>What assumptions have you made?</h4>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>GDPR, PCI-DSS, HIPAA apply in the location of pampered pets business</li>
                                                <li>The company has limited use of technology</li>
                                                <li>The company processes card payments</li>

                                        <h3>Reflection</h3>
                                        <blockquote>Much of the content writing for the team project was completed during unit 6 which, in hindsight, was poor time management. This happened because group meetings were difficult to arrange across 4 timezones, and this is something that should have been acknowledged and mitigated in the contract writing phase. Personally, I was holding back writing content as I was waiting for Fatma to make some kind of contribution to the project, which did not end up happening until 4 hours prior to the deadline. This taught me that group work is only as successful as its weakest member, and I should have been more proactive in chasing Fatma - as would be expected in a business environment. Tyrone added a great amount of quantitative analysis to the final draft which contributed to the overall success.</blockquote>
