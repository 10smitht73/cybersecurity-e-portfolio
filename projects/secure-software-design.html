                                            <p><strong>Question: </strong>Select one of the coding weaknesses which have been identified by OWASP and create a flowchart of the steps which may have led to the weakness occurring. Which UML models might you use to present the design of your proposed software, and why are they the most appropriate choice(s)?</p>
                                            <h4>Chosen Weakness: CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)</h4>
                                            <h4>OWASP</h4>
                                            <p>The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a body that assesses and collates web application vulnerabilities for the purpose of spreading awareness, and improving mitigation tactics. OWASP release ‘Top Ten’ lists which document the most common categories of vulnerabilities of the time, along with prevention tips and example scenarios (OWASP, 2021). A study by Lala et al. (2021) found that implementing the security guidance of the OWASP Top Ten can change a simple web app from “highly prone to attack” to being much more resilient to attacks such as SQL injection, and cross site scripting.</p>
                                            <h4>CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)</h4>
                                            <p>This post will focus on CSRF (sometimes referred to as session riding) as an attack strategy, which is the practice of exploiting a user's legitimate active session on a website to execute a malicious request (Anderson, 2020). In order to do so, the attacker needs to understand the URL pattern of the target website and create a bespoke URL containing a malicious request which is then embedded in a malicious link (Kombade & Meshram, 2012). When the user clicks on this link, their authenticated session cookie will be attached to this URL in the HTTP request and so the server will execute the request.</p>
                                            <p>The flowchart below demonstrates an attack along with potential mitigations that the website may have in place:</p>
                                            <span class="image"><img width="70%" src="../images/SSD CSRF Flowchart.jpg"></span>
                                            <p>This flow chart demonstrates that a threat actor does not need to rely on authenticating to execute an attack. The red path demonstrates a potentially successful attack which relies on multiple failures of the user/website:</p>
                                            <ol>
                                                <li>The user is successfully baited into clicking a link via phishing or other social engineering techniques. This outlines the need to stay vigilant and treat all links as suspicious. In corporations, it is vital to employ anti-phishing systems and conduct regular phishing training (Naqvi et al., 2023).</li>
                                                <li>The session token remains active when the user clicks on the link. Good practice to avoid this would be to log out of a website as soon as you are finished using it.</li>
                                                <li>Anti-CSRF tokens are not being used by the website. The user cannot control this, but could consider refraining from opening accounts with websites that do not employ this security feature.</li>
                                            </ol>
                                            <h4>Anti-CSRF Tokens</h4>
                                            <p>Anywhere on a website that allows a user to submit a request should have a hidden input built into the submission that contains an anti-CSRF token which is generated server-side for each request. When the user submits the request, only legitimate requests will contain the token that was generated to the user, as the attacker cannot pre-empt the randomly generated token. (Das, 2022).</p>
                                            <p>Notably, enforcing HTTPS does not prevent these attacks as it only encrypts the malicious request as opposed to validating it (Microsoft, 2023). Furthermore, it may seem sensible to only permit POST requests to prevent malicious GET requests. However, the attacker can generate a malicious form (which would submit via a POST request) as opposed to a malicious link (OWASP, N.D.).</p>
                                            <h4>UML Models</h4>
                                            <p>UML models are essential to model these weaknesses within a system from multiple perspectives, and also acts as a universal language between different teams working on the same system.</p>
                                            <p><bold>Use Case Diagram: </bold>Identifies uses of the system that a threat actor may wish to exploit - points where CSRF protection should be prioritised (Brookshear & Brylow, 2020).</p>
                                            <p><bold>Class Diagram:</bold> Displays components involved in session management and request handling, which should be analysed for CSRF protection mechanisms.</p>
                                            <p><bold>Sequence Diagram:</bold> Traces the flow of actions and communications when the user interacts with the system and, therefore, when a CSRF attack could potentially occur (Brookshear & Brylow, 2020). Anti-CSRF tokens should be validated at these points (Anderson, 2020).</p>
                                            <p>None of these diagrams should be exempt from a design document. However, the most important in terms of CSRF prevention is arguably the sequence diagram, as it plainly displays the exchange of requests.</p>

                                            <h4>Most interesting point learned</h4>
                                            <p>TOGAF (The Open Group Architecture Framework) has been criticised for lack of security focus, but can be integrated with SABSA (Sherwood Applied Business Security Architecture) for a more secure framework.</p>
                                            <h4>Key Takeaways</h4>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Waterfall faces security challenges due to its limiting top down structure, and agile faces similar issues due to timebox restraints.</li>
                                                <li>Secure design patterns such as 'interface' and 'factory' should be implemented whilst avoiding anti-patterns such as spaghetti code and copy and paste programming.</li>
                                                <li>Different stages of the SDLC often warrant different UML diagrams: early - use case; structure - class; information and data - sequence.</li>

                                        <blockquote>This unit has introduced the module, and Cathryn explains that the module is considered “challenging yet rewarding” which I would agree with so far. It is refreshing to take part in a discussion forum which is not just reading a paper and answering questions, as I believe the flowcharting will prompt more varied discussion since there are a range of topics to choose from. The discussion asks us to analyse an OWASP vulnerability, create a flowchart of the attack, and discuss suitable UML models. After my initial post, I was given feedback that I hadn’t properly introduced OWASP or my chosen vulnerability, and my flowchart and its explanation needed more detail. The comments are fair, as I had suffered a bit of a “sheep” mentality by following the format that previous students had used in their posts. I actually found that once I had drawn the flowchart out in a more detailed way, I understood the vulnerability much more as I was having to specifically acknowledge each stage of the attack and how it could be mitigated.</blockquote>
                                        <blockquote>We were allocated our teams for the group project, and our group got in contact as soon as our schedules would allow to work on the group contract. Unfortunately, Melody, a later addition to the team, was not able to make the first call, but we will be sure to keep him up to date and included. Our group decided not to assign a leader as I had suggested it is more typical of the agile framework that everyone has equal responsibility. Although, I am conscious that Samer may emerged as the natural “moderator” and Fatma seems particularly quiet (which was the case when I worked with her on a previous group task). I will take care to ensure Fatma is feeling confident and contributing, as it is important that we are all on the same page despite any shyness.</blockquote>

                                            <h4>How People Can Be Managed To Overcome Cyber Security Attacks From The Inside</h4>
                                            <p>Accidental insiders are people that, without intention, permit a cyber security attack through lack of judgement, knowledge or attention (Hadlington, 2021). These are a fundamental threat to businesses, and the following strategies should be employed to mitigate their actions:</p>
                                        
                                            <h4>Access Control</h4>
                                            <p>Users should have bespoke access rights based on their specific responsibilities - known as Role Based Access Control (RBAC). Zero trust security means that no user or device, whether inside or outside of a network can be trusted (Garbis & Chapman, 2021). This also lowers the cost of security audits as security rules are less complex (Assunção, 2019).</p>
                                        
                                            <h4>Policy</h4>
                                            <p>As well as being clear, policies must find a balance between security and usability. If a policy is too strict (such as a password policy), then it will lead to users finding a workaround (such as writing the password down) which then weakens security overall (Di Nocera & Tempestini, 2022).</p>
                                        
                                            <h4>Corrective Action</h4>
                                            <p>This could be passive (i.e. the user doesn’t necessarily know that it has happened) such as DLPS which prevents data from leaving the system (Anderson, 2020), or link checks that prevent phishing links from being clicked. It could also be more direct such as disciplinary action or revoking privileges.</p>
                                        
                                            <h4>Continual Improvement</h4>
                                            <p>Get users involved in the improvement of security. This invokes the buy-in theory - users that participate are likely to feel more engaged in the activity in the future (Spears & Barki, 2010). Users can also provide context that makes the risk management more business aligned.</p>
                                        
                                            <h4>Top Management</h4>
                                            <p>Policies should apply to all users regardless of seniority. The higher the policies apply, the easier it is to build them into culture. Security tests such as internal phishing campaigns can become a management metric for their team.</p>
                                        
                                            <p>Although this list isn’t exhaustive, it provides a step in the right direction to managing the human factor of cyber security in business.</p>

                                        <blockquote>In team 1, the initial meeting was hindered by the fact that Fatma had not made any contact in the introduction forum. This meant that we hadn’t been able to communicate with her and so only three of us were present for this initial meeting. While this allowed us to get to know each other better, the contract required that all four of us participated and so this is likely to hinder the progress of the project. Although I appreciate that this is a flexible course, it is important to adhere to deadlines - especially when working with others. I am going to take note of this for my own development and ensure that I am punctual and contributing to the team, as I understand the frustration that this may cause for others.</blockquote>
                                        <blockquote>I am excited by the prospect of the team project as it seems very imitative of a real life scenario. Unfortunately, there is very little factual data in the brief that can be used, but this does allow for more creative freedom and we will need to be careful with assumptions.</blockquote>
                                        <blockquote>Our first team call with all four members gave the impression that Tyrone and I are more comfortable providing ideas and sharing knowledge, whereas Fatma and Stephen are less confident and may need some support. We have made the decision to split the assignment into two teams with myself and Fatma working on a risk analysis of before the digitalisation, and Tyrone and Stephen working on the post digitalisation analysis. This was my suggestion to mitigate the issue of everyone working on the same section of the document which may have led to repeats or inconsistencies. However, Tyrone was slightly concerned that there may be a mismatch in the sections, and so this will need to be addressed when editing.</blockquote>
                                        <blockquote>As we are all in different timezones, I have also created and shared a reference so that we can organise calls more effectively and be mindful of each other's schedules.</blockquote>
