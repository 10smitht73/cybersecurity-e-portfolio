                                            <p><strong>Question: </strong>Select one of the coding weaknesses which have been identified by OWASP and create a flowchart of the steps which may have led to the weakness occurring. Which UML models might you use to present the design of your proposed software, and why are they the most appropriate choice(s)?</p>
                                            <h4>Chosen Weakness: CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)</h4>
                                            <h4>OWASP</h4>
                                            <p>The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a body that assesses and collates web application vulnerabilities for the purpose of spreading awareness, and improving mitigation tactics. OWASP release ‘Top Ten’ lists which document the most common categories of vulnerabilities of the time, along with prevention tips and example scenarios (OWASP, 2021). A study by Lala et al. (2021) found that implementing the security guidance of the OWASP Top Ten can change a simple web app from “highly prone to attack” to being much more resilient to attacks such as SQL injection, and cross site scripting.</p>
                                            <h4>CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)</h4>
                                            <p>This post will focus on CSRF (sometimes referred to as session riding) as an attack strategy, which is the practice of exploiting a user's legitimate active session on a website to execute a malicious request (Anderson, 2020). In order to do so, the attacker needs to understand the URL pattern of the target website and create a bespoke URL containing a malicious request which is then embedded in a malicious link (Kombade & Meshram, 2012). When the user clicks on this link, their authenticated session cookie will be attached to this URL in the HTTP request and so the server will execute the request.</p>
                                            <p>The flowchart below demonstrates an attack along with potential mitigations that the website may have in place:</p>
                                            <span class="image"><img width="70%" src="../images/SSD CSRF Flowchart.jpg"></span>
                                            <p>This flow chart demonstrates that a threat actor does not need to rely on authenticating to execute an attack. The red path demonstrates a potentially successful attack which relies on multiple failures of the user/website:</p>
                                            <ol>
                                                <li>The user is successfully baited into clicking a link via phishing or other social engineering techniques. This outlines the need to stay vigilant and treat all links as suspicious. In corporations, it is vital to employ anti-phishing systems and conduct regular phishing training (Naqvi et al., 2023).</li>
                                                <li>The session token remains active when the user clicks on the link. Good practice to avoid this would be to log out of a website as soon as you are finished using it.</li>
                                                <li>Anti-CSRF tokens are not being used by the website. The user cannot control this, but could consider refraining from opening accounts with websites that do not employ this security feature.</li>
                                            </ol>
                                            <h4>Anti-CSRF Tokens</h4>
                                            <p>Anywhere on a website that allows a user to submit a request should have a hidden input built into the submission that contains an anti-CSRF token which is generated server-side for each request. When the user submits the request, only legitimate requests will contain the token that was generated to the user, as the attacker cannot pre-empt the randomly generated token. (Das, 2022).</p>
                                            <p>Notably, enforcing HTTPS does not prevent these attacks as it only encrypts the malicious request as opposed to validating it (Microsoft, 2023). Furthermore, it may seem sensible to only permit POST requests to prevent malicious GET requests. However, the attacker can generate a malicious form (which would submit via a POST request) as opposed to a malicious link (OWASP, N.D.).</p>
                                            <h4>UML Models</h4>
                                            <p>UML models are essential to model these weaknesses within a system from multiple perspectives, and also acts as a universal language between different teams working on the same system.</p>
                                            <p><bold>Use Case Diagram: </bold>Identifies uses of the system that a threat actor may wish to exploit - points where CSRF protection should be prioritised (Brookshear & Brylow, 2020).</p>
                                            <p><bold>Class Diagram:</bold> Displays components involved in session management and request handling, which should be analysed for CSRF protection mechanisms.</p>
                                            <p><bold>Sequence Diagram:</bold> Traces the flow of actions and communications when the user interacts with the system and, therefore, when a CSRF attack could potentially occur (Brookshear & Brylow, 2020). Anti-CSRF tokens should be validated at these points (Anderson, 2020).</p>
                                            <p>None of these diagrams should be exempt from a design document. However, the most important in terms of CSRF prevention is arguably the sequence diagram, as it plainly displays the exchange of requests.</p>

                                            <h4>Most interesting point learned</h4>
                                            <p>TOGAF (The Open Group Architecture Framework) has been criticised for lack of security focus, but can be integrated with SABSA (Sherwood Applied Business Security Architecture) for a more secure framework.</p>
                                            <h4>Key Takeaways</h4>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Waterfall faces security challenges due to its limiting top down structure, and agile faces similar issues due to timebox restraints.</li>
                                                <li>Secure design patterns such as 'interface' and 'factory' should be implemented whilst avoiding anti-patterns such as spaghetti code and copy and paste programming.</li>
                                                <li>Different stages of the SDLC often warrant different UML diagrams: early - use case; structure - class; information and data - sequence.</li>

                                        <blockquote>This unit has introduced the module, and Cathryn explains that the module is considered “challenging yet rewarding” which I would agree with so far. It is refreshing to take part in a discussion forum which is not just reading a paper and answering questions on it which I find less facilitates varied discussion as everyone in making similar points. The discussion asks us to analyse an OWASP vulnerability, create a flowchart of the attack, and discuss suitable UML models. After my initial post, I was given feedback that I hadn’t properly introduced OWASP or my chosen vulnerability, and my flowchart and its explanation needed more detail. The comments were fair, as I had suffered a bit of a “sheep” mentality by following the format that previous students had used in their posts. I actually found that once I had drawn the flowchart out in a more detailed way, I understood the vulnerability much more as I was having to specifically acknowledge each stage of the attack and how it could be mitigated.</blockquote>
                                        <blockquote>We were allocated our teams for the group project, and our group got in contact as soon as our schedules would allow to work on the group contract. Unfortunately, Melody, a later addition to the team, was not able to make it, but we will be sure to keep her up to date and included. Our group decided not to assign a leader as I had suggested it is more typical of the agile framework that everyone has equal responsibility. Although, I am conscious that Samer may have emerged as the natural “moderator” and Fatma seems particularly quiet (which was the case when I worked with her on a previous group task). I will take care to ensure Fatma is feeling confident and contributing, as it is important that we are all on the same page despite any shyness.</blockquote>

                                            <p><strong>1. How did the authors use both Qualitative and Quantitative assessment approaches? What benefits did each approach yield?</strong></p>
                                            <p>A combination of data collection and analysis, interviews and surveys. Qualitative was necessary as there was very little known data on which to base a quantitative analysis, quantitative were then used to test the theoretical model defined from the qualitative study. Combining the two provided context and testability. Idea was that two different approaches to the same problem would yield a more whole picture.</p>
                                            <p><strong>2. What do the authors list as the advantages of involving users in the risk management process?</strong></p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Buy-in Theory - users that participate in risk management are likely to feel more engaged in the activity in the future.</li>
                                                <li>Organisational awareness around those who participated increased.</li>
                                                <li>Users provided context that made the risk management more business aligned.</li>
                                                <li>Good relationships form between users and IS professionals which can benefit the company in future IS endeavours.</li>

                                            </ul>
                                            <p><strong>3. How will the lack of user access affect the risk assessment you will carry out as part of your assessment?</strong></p>
                                            <p>More assumptions will have to be made to compensate for the lack of business context that users can provide. The advantages/risks will need to be explained thoroughly to demonstrate the need for compliance in lieu of the ‘buy-in’ that might have been.</p>
                                            <p><strong>4. Will it affect the choice of Qualitative vs. Quantitative assessment methods you utilise?</strong></p>
                                            <p>A mixture of qualitative and quantitative will be used as there is also limited historical data available in our study. However, the benefits and conclusions that can be taken from quantitative analysis cannot be ignored. A mixture of the two limits the number of assumptions that need to be made.</p>
                                            <p><strong>5. How might you mitigate any issues encountered?</strong></p>
                                            <p>Assumptions, as long as they are properly recorded, can be used to model the case around any issues. Before doing so, any issues should be investigated and researched to find if there is a previous encounter of this issue which has a known workaround.</p>

                                        <blockquote>In team 1, the initial meeting was hindered by the fact that Fatma had not made any contact in the introduction forum. This meant that we hadn’t been able to communicate with her and so only three of us were present for this initial meeting. While this allowed us to get to know each other better, the contract required that all four of us participated and so this is likely to hinder the progress of the project. Although I appreciate that this is a flexible course, it is important to adhere to deadlines - especially when working with others. I am going to take note of this for my own development and ensure that I am punctual and contributing to the team, as I understand the frustration that this may cause for others.</blockquote>
                                        <blockquote>I am excited by the prospect of the team project as it seems very imitative of a real life scenario. Unfortunately, there is very little factual data in the brief that can be used, but this does allow for more creative freedom and we will need to be careful with assumptions.</blockquote>
                                        <blockquote>Our first team call with all four members gave the impression that Tyrone and I are more comfortable providing ideas and sharing knowledge, whereas Fatma and Stephen are less confident and may need some support. We have made the decision to split the assignment into two teams with myself and Fatma working on a risk analysis of before the digitalisation, and Tyrone and Stephen working on the post digitalisation analysis. This was my suggestion to mitigate the issue of everyone working on the same section of the document which may have led to repeats or inconsistencies. However, Tyrone was slightly concerned that there may be a mismatch in the sections, and so this will need to be addressed when editing.</blockquote>
                                        <blockquote>As we are all in different timezones, I have also created and shared a reference so that we can organise calls more effectively and be mindful of each other's schedules.</blockquote>

                                            <h3>Collaborative Discussion 1 Finishes!</h3>
                                            <p><strong>Question: </strong>Discuss 'Industry 4.0' as explained in Kovaitė and Stankevičienė, 2019.</p>
                                            <h4>Summary Post</h4>
                                            <p>An enjoyable discussion around a topic that is very much current. Daniel, Bing and Chih have contributed to the discussion of Industry 4.0 based on the source material by Kovaitė and Stankevičienė (2019).</p>
                                            <p>Daniel and Bing agreed and furthered my point that the rapid change being experienced in industry is creating obsolescence problems with both technology and staff. As Daniel explains, assessment of staff knowledge gaps is paramount to ensure successful transition into the use of new equipment and processes (Nikou et al., 2022). Although the “human factor” is now considered the main vulnerability in business information security (Jeong et al., 2019), one might argue that it is in fact the relationship between humans and technology that will become most critical - especially as cyber physical systems become more prevalent and replace manual work.</p>
                                            <p>Chih presented further findings on the risks of IoT devices. It was proposed that, although businesses must carry out appropriate risk assessment before integrating any device with their network or equipment, this risk is also shared by the vendor whose company reputation could be impacted by their product being the weak link. Nurse et al. (2017) comment on approaches that can be taken in order to assess these risks successfully such as NIST SP800-30, OCTAVE, and CRAMM amongst others.</p>
                                            <p>The conclusion of the discussion is in agreement with the conclusion of Kovaitė and Stankevičienė (2019). Business models must implement appropriate risk assessment when transitioning to Industry 4.0 and digitisation should be embraced with careful planning. But, of course, this is not a tick box exercise to be completed once. Just as regular patching and upgrades is key to mitigate software vulnerabilities, regular risk assessment of implemented technologies throughout their use lifetime is the most comprehensive way to understand the threats of Industry 4.0.</p>

                                        <blockquote>The first collaborative discussion forum has finished and there was a clear lack of acknowledgement of the formulae described in the source material which confirms my previous reflection that it is not well explained. Daniel made a particularly interesting point that the faster technology moves on, the more likely humans are to be left behind and so it is vital to assess staff knowledge throughout the process (Nikou et al, 2022). I found that there was a high rate of agreement in the discussion which was friendly, but perhaps didn’t challenge people to prove their ideas more robustly . In future discussions, I will aim to take a more critical view of people’s arguments as my job as a tester can benefit from a critical stance that looks beyond face value.</blockquote>

                                        <blockquote>I created a plan for the team project which split the assignment into sections and gave an outline of each section along with some potential sources. I decided to make the plan simple as we hadn't elected a leader so I didn't want the rest of the team to feel that I was managing them. I shared this with the group and suggested that we each add bullet points, ideas and sources as seeing each other’s thoughts would provide the perspective that is needed for a group task (Salas et al., 2018). We will discuss this in our next group call and then start putting content into the final document draft. Tyrone has given positive feedback on the plan, but has added his own sources to the plan which will give a more rounded argument. Fatma has told me that she doesn’t she doesn’t feel that it needs any additions which I consider to be short-sighted and a poor team contribution. I reacted as if this was a good thing, but on reflection I believe I should have persuaded Fatma to make some of her own comments for the sake of her confidence and personal development.</blockquote>

                                            <h4><strong>Case Study:</strong> Personal Data Withheld from an Access Request by Airbnb on the Basis of an Opinion Given in Confidence</h4>
                                            
                                            <h4>What is the specific aspect of GDPR that your case study addresses?</h4>
                                            <p>The case study addresses the right for a data subject to access any personal data held by a data controller on them (Article 15 of GDPR) (ICO, 2016). More specifically, a data subject wants access to personal data held on them including an email of complaint written about the data subject by another third party. The data controller had to balance the right to this access with the exemptions that can apply when a confidential opinion is expressed.</p>
                                            
                                            <h4>How was it resolved?</h4>
                                            <p>As the third party had informed the data subject that they had contacted the data controller, and most of the email was considered factual, the email was ordered to be shared with the data subject as the exemption did not apply.</p>
                                            
                                            <h4>If this was your organisation what steps would you take as an Information Security Manager to mitigate the issue?</h4>
                                            <p>This reminds me of when I was working as a customer service advisor for Hargreaves Lansdown and we were trained not to write anything untoward about clients in their file even if it was an internal communication as this may have to be released to them under an access request. This should be the foundation of any company that any data on a subject should be treated as if they are constantly watching what you are doing with it. Ensuring appropriate policies should be paramount, but balancing the strictness is also important. They must be strict enough to adhere to GDPR, but if they are too strict then the Peltzman effect can take effect which makes people feel less risk averse, and in fact they may find a workaround (Stetzer & Hofmann, 1996).</p>

                                        <blockquote>The GDPR case study this week was exciting and beneficial to my development as a cyber security professional as cyber security is at the core of data protection (Gobeo et al., 2022). Cyber security analysts may consider GDPR to be a legal issue and not part of their day job, but legal implications of their work can be instrumental to business failings. Analysing a real life case study shows how these regulations actually affect real life, and the case study that I chose in particular was eye opening as it demonstrated that real situations can be multi-faceted. A company exercising the right to withhold information under GDPR was in fact breaching the subject's right to access their own data. In my own personal development, I translate this as a reinforcement that consequences of actions should always consider how others will be affected to avoid future implications.</blockquote>

                                            <p><strong>Title: </strong>Security Standards</p>
                                            <h4>Activity Notes</h4>
                                            <p>Review GDPR, PCI, and HIPAA and answer the questions:</p>
                                            <h4>Which of the standards discussed in the sources above would apply to the organisation discussed in the assessment?</h4>
                                            <p>For example, a company providing services to anyone living in Europe or a European-based company or public body would most likely be subject to <strong>GDPR</strong>. A company handling online payments would most likely need to meet <strong>PCI-DSS</strong> standards. While pampered pets use of technology is limited, any personal information in the form of emailed orders (and other uses) would mean that <strong>GDPR</strong> still applies. <strong>PCI-DSS</strong> will most certainly apply as the company accepts card payments. <strong>HIPAA</strong> is unlikely to apply, but may in the case that the company has any pet food that specifically caters to medical conditions then those clients' privacy would need to be protected.</p>

                                            <h4>Evaluate the company against the appropriate standards and decide how would you check if standards were being met?</h4>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li><strong>GDPR:</strong> the company's data collection and storage practices would need to be evaluated. In the case of email ordering, could anyone access this without permission? Are there processes in place in the case of data subject access rights such as collation of customer data as it is processed?</li>
                                                <li><strong>PCI-DSS:</strong> assess how payments are taken and how this is recorded. Are they physically secure (such as payment receipts) as well as electronically secure?</li>
                                                <li><strong>HIPAA:</strong> pampered pets would have to audit their products to ensure that clients can not be identified by purchases of health related products. How is pet health information stored?</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <p>To check if standards are being met, documents should be reviewed and audited, inspections of physical security may take place, and CCTV may be looked at.</p>

                                            <h4>What would your recommendations be to meet those standards?</h4>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li><strong>GDPR:</strong> Customer data should be secured both physically and electronically. Any written records throughout the day need to be secured or disposed of. Staff should be trained on the rights of data subjects and responsibilities of data controllers. Procedures should be in place in the case that those rights are exercised.</li>
                                                <li><strong>PCI-DSS:</strong> Ensure any card terminals are compliant with the standards. Cardholder data shouldn’t be stored unless absolutely necessary. Receipts should be kept safe and secure.</li>
                                                <li><strong>HIPAA:</strong> Similar to GDPR but with focus on any pet health records (or health conditions on pet owners for other purposes), access controls, data encryption.</li>
                                            </ul>

                                            <h4>What assumptions have you made?</h4>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>GDPR, PCI-DSS, HIPAA apply in the location of pampered pets business</li>
                                                <li>The company has limited use of technology</li>
                                                <li>The company processes card payments</li>
                                            </ul>

                                        <h3>Reflection</h3>
                                        <blockquote>Much of the content writing for the team project was completed during unit 6 which, in hindsight, was poor time management. This happened because group meetings were difficult to arrange across 4 timezones, and this is something that should have been acknowledged and mitigated in the contract writing phase. Personally, I was holding back writing content as I was waiting for Fatma to make some kind of contribution to the project, which did not end up happening until 4 hours prior to the deadline. This taught me that group work is only as successful as its weakest member, and I should have been more proactive in chasing Fatma - as would be expected in a business environment. Tyrone added a great amount of quantitative analysis to the final draft which contributed to the overall success.</blockquote>
