                                            <p><strong>Question: </strong>Discuss 'Industry 4.0' as explained in Kovaitė and Stankevičienė, 2019.</p>
                                            <h4>Initial Post</h4>
                                            <p>Kovaitė and Stankevičienė (2019) discuss Industry 4.0: the 4th industrial revolution that evolves from the internet and automation age into the age of cyber physical systems (Loughlin, 2018). One of the technologies discussed as driving this revolution is the Internet of Things (IoT) which has allowed normal devices and tools to become a complex network of sensors collecting varied data across all industries. These diverse and vast datasets can then in turn be interpreted and analysed in another Industry 4.0 technology, known as Big Data. Together these advancements allow devices to be aware of their own context and make decisions to optimise their performance (Gokalp et al., 2016).</p>
                                            <p>IoT devices are continually upgrading by nature. Technological advancements, security patches and volatility of legislation surrounding these new devices mean that products are quickly obsolete - which would be categorised as a technical risk by Kovaitė and Stankevičienė (2019). The culture shift towards cloud services has happened within a single workforce generation, and so companies can easily find themselves with staff who are unable to use this technology to its full potential (not to mention optimal configuration). The paper would categorise this as an example of a competence risk.</p>
                                            <p>Mekhdiev et al. (2023) agrees that a corporate risk landscape is clearly impacted by digitisation, and requires a new model to anticipate these new risks. However, they also go on to suggest that this model should focus on highlighting the advantages which are often the adverse of the risks. It is suggested that this is the only way to truly offset the risks of digitisation.</p>

                                            <p><strong>Question: </strong>Discuss 'Industry 4.0' as explained in Kovaitė and Stankevičienė, 2019.</p>
                                            <h4>Summary Post</h4>
                                            <p>An enjoyable discussion around a topic that is very much current. Daniel, Bing and Chih have contributed to the discussion of Industry 4.0 based on the source material by Kovaitė and Stankevičienė (2019).</p>
                                            <p>Daniel and Bing agreed and furthered my point that the rapid change being experienced in industry is creating obsolescence problems with both technology and staff. As Daniel explains, assessment of staff knowledge gaps is paramount to ensure successful transition into the use of new equipment and processes (Nikou et al., 2022). Although the “human factor” is now considered the main vulnerability in business information security (Jeong et al., 2019), one might argue that it is in fact the relationship between humans and technology that will become most critical - especially as cyber physical systems become more prevalent and replace manual work.</p>
                                            <p>Chih presented further findings on the risks of IoT devices. It was proposed that, although businesses must carry out appropriate risk assessment before integrating any device with their network or equipment, this risk is also shared by the vendor whose company reputation could be impacted by their product being the weak link. Nurse et al. (2017) comment on approaches that can be taken in order to assess these risks successfully such as NIST SP800-30, OCTAVE, and CRAMM amongst others.</p>
                                            <p>The conclusion of the discussion is in agreement with the conclusion of Kovaitė and Stankevičienė (2019). Business models must implement appropriate risk assessment when transitioning to Industry 4.0 and digitisation should be embraced with careful planning. But, of course, this is not a tick box exercise to be completed once. Just as regular patching and upgrades is key to mitigate software vulnerabilities, regular risk assessment of implemented technologies throughout their use lifetime is the most comprehensive way to understand the threats of Industry 4.0.</p>

                                            <p><strong>Question: </strong>Discuss CVSS as critiqued by Spring et al, 2021.</p>
                                            <h4>Initial Post</h4>
                                            <p><strong>Criticisms</strong></p>
                                            <p>Spring et al. (2021) criticise the use of CVSS due to the emphasis on qualitative input. I agree with Spring et al. that this approach makes the analysis more subjective, as the paper mentions that the same vulnerability can be scored differently enough by two professionals to fall into separate risk levels. Altenback (1995) goes as far to say that an entirely qualitative approach is useless enough that it is rarely appropriate. Furthermore, any comparison between vulnerabilities is equally subjective, and performing any mathematical operations on qualitative data is impossible. This is exacerbated by the opaque nature of the CVSS algorithm which, as Spring et al. explain, prevents an understanding of distances between arbitrary labels.</p>
                                            <p>Another criticism is the equal weighting between the CIA triad of confidentiality, integrity, and confidentiality, and I agree with Spring et al. that there are many situations where these should not be considered equal. Further to the examples given in the paper, a research institution would be more focused on the integrity of its findings to ensure it remains accurate. However, regardless of organisational context, Qadir & Quadri (2016) suggest that availability is generally more important by default, as the other two are dependent on the data being available.</p>
                                            <p><strong>Alternative</strong></p>
                                            <p>Spring et al. suggest that SSVC (Stakeholder Specific Vulnerability Categorisation) is a solution to these criticisms. Having used the calculator myself, I would argue that the prompts still rely on purely qualitative data, and none of the prompts (or the user guide) mention any of the CIA triad (CISA, 2023). However, the guidance that supplement the prompts is more thorough and directive, which will likely make scores more repeatable by different professionals. Interestingly, the output of the algorithm is an action to take as opposed to a severity score. Is this more helpful than a severity score, or could it possibly lead to complacency if little action is recommended?</p>

                                            <p><strong>Question: </strong>Discuss CVSS as critiqued by Spring et al, 2021.</p>
                                            <h4>Summary Post Post</h4>
                                            <p>An interesting and varied discussion on the Spring et al. 2021 paper on the common vulnerability scoring system (CVSS). Much of the discussion agreed with Spring et al. criticisms of CVSS, and that it does not seem entirely suitable as a risk score. Altenback’s point (1995) that an entirely qualitative approach is useless was modernised by Daniel Malok who explained Stewart’s 2023 observation that both qualitative and quantitative approaches have their benefits and drawbacks. As Chih Ming Lee explained, differences in scoring the same vulnerability by two professionals cannot be forgiven, as the different actions taken can end up being wholly unsuitable. However, as the user guide states emphatically, CVSS is not a risk score (FIRST, 2023), and so perhaps action should not be taken solely on calculation of a severity score - severity without likelihood is difficult to action.</p>
                                            <p>Replacement of CVSS was also discussed with SSVC being most commonly proposed. Daniel Malok presented SSVC as more transparent and based on decisions (Metcalf, 2023) which I agree with having used the calculator, as the guidance is much more clear and thorough. However, CVSS and SSVC appear to be measuring different things as SSVC is indeed a risk score (Spring et al. 2021). Instead of replacing CVSS, I believe it is more important to educate professionals on the use cases of these differing scores and, as Chih Ming Lee stated, allow them to complement each other. In the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), multiple scores should be offered with clear explanations of how they should be interpreted, in order to prevent CVSS being assumed as a risk score (Howland, 2023). Bing Hung Lui suggests that CVSS 4.0 will provide improvements that can counter the issues that Spring et al. describe, but, without proper understanding of the use case for CVSS, I would be concerned that any improvements to CVSS might only exacerbate its misuse.</p>
                                            <p>The discussion agrees with Spring et al. that something must change with CVSS, but SSVC may not be the optimal solution either.</p>
